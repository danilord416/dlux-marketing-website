                        <h2>About the Founder</h2>
                        <p>DLux Marketing was founded by Dani Lord, a digital marketer who grew up alongside the internet and never saw marketing as one-size-fits-all. After graduating from Florida Gulf Coast University in 2021, Dani watched countless small businesses struggle during COVID — not because they weren't great at what they did, but because they didn't have a strong online presence to back them up.</p>
                        <p>As someone from a generation that doesn't just "Google it," Dani brings a modern perspective to digital marketing. Today, people discover businesses through social media, creators they trust, online communities, and shared content — and marketing has to reflect that reality. That mindset shapes everything at DLux, from strategy to execution.</p>
                        <p>DLux Marketing was founded in fall 2021 with a simple goal: give small and mid-sized businesses marketing support that's flexible, approachable, and actually useful. Dani built DLux to be a plug-in partner — whether a business needs help with a one-off project or ongoing marketing support. She loves helping brands grow in ways that feel intentional, creative, and aligned with how people connect with businesses today.</p>
