## Critical Next Steps to Get Found on Google

### 1. Submit Your Site to Google Search Console (MOST IMPORTANT)

This is the #1 reason your site isn't showing up. Google needs to know your site exists.

**Steps:**
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Add Property" → "URL prefix"
4. Enter your website URL: `https://www.dlux-marketing.com`
5. Verify ownership using one of these methods:
   - **HTML file upload** (easiest for Netlify)
   - **HTML tag** (add meta tag to your homepage)
   - **DNS verification** (if you have a custom domain)
6. Once verified, click "Request Indexing" for your homepage

**After verification:**
- Submit your sitemap: Go to "Sitemaps" → Add `https://www.dlux-marketing.com/sitemap.xml`
- Request indexing for your main pages (homepage, services, about)

### 2. Make Sure Your Site is Live and Accessible

- Check that your site loads properly
- Make sure there are no password protections blocking Google
- Test on mobile devices

### 3. Build Some Backlinks (Over Time)

Google needs to see that other sites link to you. Some ways to get started:
- List your business on Google Business Profile (if you have a physical location)
- Add your site to your social media profiles
- Get listed in local business directories
- Reach out to partners/clients for testimonials with links

### 4. Create More Content

- Add more blog posts regularly
- Update your services pages with more detail
- Add case studies or portfolio items

### 5. Be Patient

- It can take **2-4 weeks** for Google to index your site after submission
- Ranking for "DLux Marketing" specifically may take longer
- Focus on getting indexed first, then rankings will improve over time

## How to Check if Google Has Indexed Your Site

1. Go to Google Search Console → "Coverage" report
2. Or search Google for: `site:www.dlux-marketing.com`
3. If pages show up, you're indexed!
